excerpt: 'We made the first detection of deueterium in an extrasolar atmosphere through the detection of deuterated methane and constrain a one part-per-billion abundance of phosphine in WISE 0855. We performed a suite of retrievals on two independant JWST NIRSpec G395M spectra of the object and preform cross correlation analyses to confirm our findings.'
