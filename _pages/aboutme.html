I grew up in Chicago, Illinois, and earned my first undergraduate degree from Towson University in Maryland majoring in Family Science and Psychology. While at Towson, I was a member and captain (sophomore through senior years) of the Division I Swimming and Diving team. Towson enabled me to fulfill two of my childhood dreams of qualifying for and competing at the 2012 U.S. Olympic Team Trials and the 2014 NCAA Division I Championships.  

<br/><br/>After I graduated, I began working for WRMA, Inc. (a contractor for the Department of Health and Human Services) doing child welfare research. I decided to go back to school to study physics and astronomy after reading <i>The Martian</i> in 2015. I got my second undergraduate degree from the University of Maryland majoring in Physics and Astronomy and minoring in Planetary Science.

<br/><br/>Since moving to Austin, I've enjoyed swimming in Barton Springs, hiking in the foothills around Austin, and teaching tricks to my cat, <a href="https://melrows.github.io/images/ladybri.jpg">Lady Brienne</a>.
