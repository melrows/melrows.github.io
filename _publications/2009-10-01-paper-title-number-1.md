excerpt: 'We performed a suite of retrievals on synthetic Sonora Bobcat models to show how different pressure-temperature profile parameterizations and uniform-with-pressure chemical abundance profiles can bias retrieved parameters. We develop a non-uniform abundance profile parameterization and identify specific gases and effective temperatures where such a parameterization may be needed.'
